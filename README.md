# Design Patterns[ยน]

## Definition

- General and repeatable solution to common problems in software design.
- High-level description or template to be adapted for a particular situation.
- Consist of:

  - **Intent**: brief description of the problem and the solution.
  - **Motivation**: dive description of the problem and how it will be solved.
  - **Structure**: complete organization (classes, relations and interactions).
  - **Applicability**: development cost and complexity analysis.
  - **Implementation steps**: step by step implementation description.
  - **Code examples**: easy examples.

## Criticism

- The pattern complexity depends on the programming language abstraction level.
- It's necessary to consider the application scope to adapt the pattern.
- It's necessary to analyse the application complexity before considering the use of patterns.

### Benefits

- Provides a consolidated (tested and proven) solution.
- Speeds up the development process.
- Improves code readability for everyone familiar with the pattern.
- Standardizes software interactions.

## Classification

- [Structural patterns](structural_patterns/structural_patterns.md)
